# PLCHoney

## Overview
With the emergence of virtual PLCs, we introduce the honeypot PLCHoney, to overcome the existing challenges in a cost-effective approach. We designed and implemented PLCHoney with a proxy profiler, dockerized virtual PLCs, a physical process simulator, and a security analysis engine. PLCHoney was able to correctly simulate responses to various internet requests and tested effectively on a network of virtualized traffic light applications. We enabled further security analysis with a dataset containing PLC I/O status, collected with and without attacks.
